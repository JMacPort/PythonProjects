#There are many tutorials of this on youtube, so I decided I would try it out for myself and get an introduction to a more standard programming language than a specific one such as powershell. This specific keylogger
#follows David Bombals video and simply records each key press along with the date/time they were pressed.

#Change file format to .pyw to get the file to run without a console or .py to run with console. Not for malicious purposes, simply a short demo.
